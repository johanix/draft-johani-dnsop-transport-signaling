<t>This document proposes a mechanism for authoritative DNS servers to
opportunistically signal their support for alternative transport
protocols (e.g., DNS over TLS (DoT), DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over
QUIC (DoQ)) directly within the Additional section of authoritative
DNS responses. This "hint-based" approach aims to enable resolvers to
discover and upgrade transport connections more efficiently, thereby
improving privacy, security, and performance for subsequent
interactions.</t>

<t>The mechanism is designed to not require any protocol change. It is
safe, backward-compatible, and effective even when DNSSEC validation
of the hint is not possible or desired.</t>

<t>This document proposes an improvement on the opportunistic (but blind)
testing of alternative transports suggested in RFC9539 by providing a
mechanism by which a responding authoritative server may signal what
alternative transports it supports.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>1. Introduction</name>

<t>The Domain Name System (DNS) primarily relies on UDP and TCP for
communication between resolvers and authoritative servers.  While
these protocols are well-established, there is a growing interest in
leveraging modern transport protocols like DNS over TLS (DoT)
<xref target="RFC7858"/>, DNS over HTTPS (DoH) <xref target="RFC9461"/> and DNS over QUIC
(DoQ) <xref target="RFC9250"/> to enhance privacy, security, and performance.</t>

<t>Existing efforts to signal service connection information, such as the
SVCB and HTTPS DNS records <xref target="RFC9460"/> <xref target="RFC9461"/>, primarily focus
on service discovery mechanisms where a client explicitly queries for
these records, often from a parent zone. While robust, this approach
can introduce additional latency and requires explicit configuration
at the parent zone level.</t>

<t>This document proposes an "DNS Opportunistic Transport Signaling" (DNS
OTS) mechanism. DNS OTS, aka an "OTS Hint" allows an authoritative DNS
nameserver to directly convey its transport capabilities as a hint
within the Additional section of responses to queries where it
identifies itself as an authoritative nameserver for the requested
zone. This direct, in-band signaling provides a low-latency discovery
path, even when a formal, validated signal is not available. Furthermore,
this is achieved without any changes to the DNS Protocol.</t>

<section anchor="prior-art"><name>1.1. Prior Art</name>

<t>An attempt at utilizing more modern, and in particular, more private
transports between resolvers and authoritative nameservers was introduced
in <xref target="RFC9539"/>. The idea there was to opportunistically try to send the
query to the authoritative nameserver over multiple transports with no
prior knowledge of whether a transport was supported in the receiving end
or not.</t>

<t>The drawback with that approach is that without any significant deployment
of authoritative support the resolver end will mostly spend cycles and
traffic on a wasted effort. For this reason there seems not to be any known
implementations.</t>

<t>Furthermore, in Appendix B of <xref target="RFC9539"/> requirements for improving
the defense against an active attacker are listed. The first requirement is:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A signaling mechanism that tells the recursive resolver that the
authoritative server intends to offer authenticated encryption.</t>
</list></t>

<t>This document aims to provide exactly such a mechanism while staying within
the current DNS protocol. Therefore the transport signaling provided will
be opportunistic, and as such fit well as an improvement to <xref target="RFC9539"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="rationale-for-using-the-additional-section"><name>Rationale for Using the Additional Section</name>

<t><strong>Note to the RFC Editor</strong>: Please remove this entire section before publication.</t>

<t>When designing a mechanism that rely on sending new information in DNS
responses without changing the current DNS protocol, the Additional section
has the major advantage of being ignored by legacy software. This property
makes it possible to essentially deploy the proposed mechanism immediately,
as it will not cause problems with existing DNS infrastructure.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Existing authoritative nameservers will not provide any OTS Hint in the
Additional section.</t>
  <t>Existing resolvers will actively ignore any OTS Hint in the Additional section.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Only DNS nameservers (authoritative or recursive) that are aware of the
proposed mechanism will use it.</t>

<t>The downside is that it is not possible to strictly rely on anything
specific being present in the Additional section, as it may be stripped off by
a middle man or even by the sending nameserver (eg. due to packet size
constraints). For this reason it is not possible to provide more than an
opportunistic transport signal.</t>

<t>Another issue is whether the data provided may be trusted or not. This is
usually a major issue and the primary reason that data in the Additional
section is actively ignored by resolvers. In this particular case, though,
even an untrusted transport signal is better than no signal at all. Furthermore,
the only effect of a forged or otherwise incorrect transport signal is a,
typically failed, connection attempt to an authoritative nameserver that
does not support the advertised transport. This will cause immediate fallback
to "Do53", i.e. traditional DNS over UDP/TCP and the non-availability of the
advertised transport will be remembered by the resolver (for some suitable time).</t>

<t>Hence, using the Additional section for opportunistic transport signaling has
vastly more benefits than drawbacks.</t>

<section anchor="the-opportunistic-signaling-mechanism"><name>3. The Opportunistic Signaling Mechanism</name>

<t>The core of this proposal is for an authoritative nameserver to
include an SVCB record in the Additional section of its responses
under specific conditions.</t>

<t>This consists of three parts. The first two are the behaviour of the
authoritative nameserver receiving the query and the rehaviour of the
recursive nameserver receiving the response. The final part is a new
EDNS(0) option that defines an OPT-OUT capability.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="authoritative-nameserver-behaviour"><name>4. Authoritative Nameserver Behaviour</name>

<section anchor="trigger-conditions-for-including-the-ots-hint"><name>4.1. Trigger Conditions for Including the OTS Hint</name>

<t>An authoritative nameserver SHOULD include an OTS Hint when <em>all</em> of
the following conditions are met:</t>

<t><list style="numbers" type="1">
  <t><strong>NS RRset Presence:</strong> An NS Resource Record Set (RRset) for the
queried zone is present in either the Answer section or the Authority
section of the DNS response.</t>
  <t><strong>Self-Identification:</strong> The responding authoritative nameserver's
own Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) (or one of its configured
aliases/identities) is found within the NS RRset mentioned in
condition 1.</t>
  <t><strong>Transport Capability:</strong> The responding authoritative nameserver
supports one or more alternative transport protocols (e.g., DoT, DoH,
DoQ) and is configured to advertise these capabilities.</t>
  <t><strong>Absence of the No-OTS Option:</strong> The query does not
include an EDNS(0) No-OTS option from the resolver.</t>
  <t><strong>Availability of RRSIG SVCB:</strong> If the zone in which the nameserver
name is located is signed, only include the SVCB record if it is
possible to also include the corresponding RRSIG SVCB. If the zone with
the nameserver name is unsigned, then include the SVCB even without the
RRSIG.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="multiple-server-identities"><name>4.2. Multiple Server Identities</name>

<t>An authoritative nameserver may be known by multiple FQDNs (e.g.,
ns1.example.com, dns.customer.org, ns.cdnprovider.net). To facilitate
condition 2 ("Self-Identification"), authoritative server
implementations MAY include a configuration mechanism (e.g., an
identities list) where operators can list all FQDNs by which the
server is known. This allows the server to correctly identify itself
regardless of the specific name used in the NS RRset.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="format-of-the-ots-hint"><name>4.3. Format of the OTS Hint</name>

<t>The OTS Hint MUST be an SVCB record with the following
characteristics:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><strong>OWNER:</strong> The owner name of the SVCB record MUST be the FQDN of the
authoritative nameserver itself, as identified in the NS RRset that
triggered its inclusion (e.g., ns.dnsprovider.com.).</t>
  <t><strong>CLASS:</strong> IN (Internet).</t>
  <t><strong>TYPE:</strong> SVCB.</t>
  <t><strong>TTL:</strong> The TTL of the SVCB record SHOULD be chosen by the
 authoritative server operator. Choice of TTL is a local configuration
 decision, but unless the supported transports are subject to frequent
 change a value on the order of 24h or more is suggested.</t>
  <t><strong>SVCB_PRIORITY:</strong> 1. The specific priority value is not critical
 for this hint mechanism, but 1 indicates the highest priority for the
 service.</t>
  <t><strong>SVCB_TARGET:</strong> . (root). This indicates that the DNS transport
 capabilities described by the SVCB record refer to the owner name of
 the record.</t>
  <t><strong>SVCB_PARAMS:</strong> A set of Service Parameters indicating the
 supported transport protocols. In this document only the "alpn"
 parameter <xref target="RFC9460"/> is defined, as relevant for signaling DoT
 (alpn=dot), DoH (alpn=doh) and DoQ (alpn=doq).  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
If any other parameter, including "ipv4hint" and "ipv6hint", is present in the
 SVCB parameter list then it SHOULD be ignored.</t>
</list></t>

<t><strong>Example 1:</strong></t>

<t>If ns.dnsprovider.net. responds to a query for www.example.com. and
ns.dnsprovider.net is listed in the NS RRset, it may respond with a
DNS message that contains:
~~~
Header: ...</t>

<t>Answer:
www.example.com.   IN A 1.2.3.4</t>

<t>Authority:
example.com.       IN NS ns1.example.com.
example.com.       IN NS ns.dnsprovider.net.</t>

<t>Additional:
ns.dnsprovider.net. IN A 5.6.7.8
ns.dnsprovider.net. IN RRSIG A ...
ns.dnsprovider.net. IN SVCB 1 . "alpn=doq,dot,do53"
ns.dnsprovider.net. IN RRSIG SVCB ...
~~~
<strong>Example 2:</strong></t>

<t>If the unsigned zone example.com uses ns.dnsprovider.net., but under the
vanity name "ns2.example.com." (with the same IP addresses), then a
possible response from ns.dnsprovider.net (aka ns2.example.com) may be:
~~~
Header: ...</t>

<t>Answer:
www.example.com.   IN A 1.2.3.4</t>

<t>Authority:
example.com.       IN NS ns1.example.com.
example.com.       IN NS ns2.example.com.</t>

<t>Additional:
ns2.example.com. IN A 5.6.7.8
ns2.example.com. IN SVCB 1 . "alpn=doq,dot,do53"
~~~
This requires that "ns2.example.com." is a name that ns.dnsprovider.net. is
aware of as one of its identities. Furthermore, as the zone example.com is
unsigned it is not possible to provide a DNSSEC signed OTS Hint in the
second example.</t>

<section anchor="recursive-nameserver-behavior"><name>5. Recursive Nameserver Behavior</name>

<t><list style="numbers" type="1">
  <t><strong>OPT-OUT Possibility:</strong> If the resolver already thinks that it
knows the transport capabilities of the authoritative nameserver
it is about to send a query to it may opt out from DNS transport
signaling by including an EDNS(0) "No-OTS" option in the query.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="when-receiving-responses"><name>5.2. When Receiving Responses</name>

<t><list style="numbers" type="1">
  <t><strong>Opportunistic Parsing:</strong> When receiving an authoritative DNS
response, the resolver SHOULD parse the Additional section for SVCB
records.</t>
  <t><strong>Owner Check:</strong> If an SVCB record is found whose owner name

Answer sections of the <em>current</em> response, the resolver MAY consider
this an OTS Hint.</t>
  <t><strong>DNSSEC Validation (Optional but Recommended):</strong>
* The resolver SHOULD attempt to DNSSEC validate the OTS Hint. This
involves validating the SVCB record itself and its corresponding RRSIG
(if present) against the DNSSEC chain of trust for the zone that owns
the SVCB record (e.g., dnsprovider.com for ns.dnsprovider.com).</t>
</list></t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>If validation succeeds: The OTS Hint is considered a <strong>trusted
signal</strong>. The resolver MAY then prefer the signaled alternative

  <t>If validation fails, or no RRSIG is present: The OTS Hint MUST
be treated as an <strong>unvalidated hint</strong>. The resolver MAY still
opportunistically attempt to use the signaled alternative transports,
but MUST be prepared for immediate fallback to traditional transports
(UDP/TCP) if the connection fails. This is particularly relevant for
scenarios like vanity names (e.g., ns.customer.com where customer.com
is an unsigned zone, but the underlying server ns.dnsprovider.com is
capable).</t>
</list></t>

<t><list style="numbers" type="1">
  <t><strong>Prioritization:</strong>

</list></t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The OTS Hint is a mechanism to <em>discover</em> capabilities
opportunistically, not to override trusted delegation or service
configuration.</t>
</list></t>

<t><list style="numbers" type="1">
  <t>Fallback: Resolvers MUST always be prepared to fall back to
traditional UDP/TCP transport if an attempt to use an alternative
transport based on an OTS Hint (especially an unvalidated one) fails
or times out.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="authentication-of-the-authoritative-nameserver"><name>5.3. Authentication of the Authoritative Nameserver</name>

<t>Authentication of the authoritative nameserver is not an explicit goal.
The reason is that as an opportunistic mechanism it will not always be
possible to do such authentication. Some of the options that do exist
are listed below.</t>

<t>Authentication of the authoritative nameserver may be done either by
validation of a DNSSEC RRSIG over the SVCB record containing the OTS
Hint or by verification of the server certificate presented in the
set up of the communication (be it over DoT, DoQ or DoH).</t>

<t>As there will not always be a DNSSEC signature to validate that option
is opportunistic at best. Likewise, while it may sometimes be possible
to validate the server cert against a DNSSEC-signed TLSA record, it will
not always be an option.</t>

<t>Finally, validating the server cert against a list of well-known public
Certificate Authorities is possible, but there is no standardized way
to determine which CAs are appropriate for DNS server certificates.</t>

<t>However, even without strong authentication of the authoritative server
the proposed mechanism still provides benefits (privacy, potential
performance improvements) and for that reason cryptographic verification
of the server identity is not a requirement.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="resolver-caching-strategies"><name>5.4. Resolver Caching Strategies</name>

<t>Resolvers implementing the DNS OTS Hint mechanism have several options
for caching the transport signals received via OTS Hints.</t>

<t>A suggested primary strategy is to set the EDNS(0) No-OTS option
when no transport signaling information is needed (because the resolver
already knows the authoritative nameservers transport capabilities from
a previous response or for some other reason).</t>

<t>Three example caching strategies are listed below. Other strategies are
possible. Each strategy has different trade-offs in terms of efficiency,
responsiveness to changes, and resource usage:</t>

<t><list style="numbers" type="1">
  <t><strong>Standard DNS Cache:</strong> Treat the SVCB record like any other DNS
record, caching it according to its TTL. This is the simplest
approach and will simply cause the resolver to fall back to UDP for
one query if the transport signal data has expired.</t>
  <t><strong>Cache-Until-Fail:</strong> Cache the transport signal until a
connection attempt fails, then invalidate the cached entry. This
approach uses more aggressive caching based on the assumption that
changes to transport capabilites are expected to be rare, and there
is no risk of presenting any data that is no longer correct. The
possible downside is that the resolver will not learn about possible
new transports that become available. E.g., with an "alpn=doq", the
resolver will not learn that the authoritative server later started
to support DNS-over-TLS (in addition to DoQ) if it is successfully
using the DNS-over-QUIC connection.</t>
  <t><strong>Success-Based Refresh:</strong> Refresh the transport signal cache entry
each time a successful connection is made using that
transport. This provides a balance between efficiency and
responsiveness but requires additional bookkeeping.</t>
</list></t>

<t>For a more detailed analysis of possible caching logic, see <xref target="RFC9539"/>,
section 4.</t>

<t>Note that the resolver always has the option of not using the EDNS(0)
No-OTS option whenever the cache entry is getting close to expiry.</t>

<t>Given the variety of deployment scenarios and operational
requirements, this document does not mandate a specific caching
strategy. Implementers SHOULD choose a strategy that best fits their
operational needs, considering factors such as:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The importance of minimizing connection attempts</t>
  <t>The impact of failed connection attempts</t>
  <t>The computational cost of different caching strategies</t>
  <t>The memory requirements of maintaining cache state</t>
</list></t>

<t>The chosen strategy SHOULD be documented in the implementation's
configuration options to allow operators to make informed decisions
about its use.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="the-edns0-no-ots-option"><name>6. The EDNS(0) No-OTS Option</name>

<t>To provide a mechanism for resolvers to explicitly opt out of
receiving transport signals, this document defines a new EDNS(0)
option called "No-OTS" (NOTS). When included in a query, this
option signals to the authoritative server that the resolver does not
want to receive any transport signals in the response.</t>

<t>The typical use case is to set the EDNS(0) No-OTS option when
the resolver already has the transport information it needs.</t>

<t>The EDNS(0) No-OTS option is structured as follows:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
                                               1   1   1   1   1   1
       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0   1   2   3   4   5

<t>Field definition details:</t>

<t>OPTION-CODE:
    2 octets / 16 bits (defined in <xref target="RFC6891"/>) contains the value TBD
    for No-OTS.</t>

<t>OPTION-LENGTH:
    2 octets / 16 bits (defined in <xref target="RFC6891"/>) contains
    the length of the payload in octets. For the No-OTS option,
    this value MUST be 0 as there is no payload.</t>

<t>When an authoritative server receives a query containing the EDNS(0)
No-OTS option, it SHOULD NOT include any OTS Hints in the
response, regardless of whether it would normally do so based on the
conditions described in Section 3.1.</t>

<t>This option provides a clean way for resolvers to opt out of receiving
transport signals, which may be useful in scenarios where:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The resolver has already established transport preferences for a
particular authoritative server</t>
  <t>The resolver does not support or does not want to use alternative
transports</t>
  <t>The resolver wants to minimize response sizes</t>
  <t>The resolver is operating in an environment where transport signals
are not needed or desired</t>
</list></t>

<t>The No-OTS option is designed to be a simple, lightweight
mechanism that can be used to disable transport signaling without
affecting the normal operation of DNS resolution.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="comparison-with-deleg"><name>7. Comparison with DELEG</name>

<t>The idea to use an SVCB alpn parameter for transport signaling
originated with the work on DELEG <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-deleg"/>.  The
current document uses the same data format, but as an opportunistic
addition to the Additional section rather than as integral part of a
changed delegation mechanism.</t>

<t>Both mechanisms have distinct use cases, and pros and cons. The major
advantage of the DELEG mechanism is that it cannot be spoofed or
filtered, as it is an integral part of an upcoming protocol change.</t>

<t>The opportunistic mechanism described here has the major advantage of
being available immediately without any changes to the DNS
protocol. Furthermore, as it is a signal directly from an
authoritative nameserver, a single OTS Hint may allow the recipient
recursive nameserver to upgrade the transport used for all the zones
served by that authoritative nameserver (which may be millions)
without the need to make any changes to the zones, nor to the parent
zones.</t>

<t>Given the current DNS landscape with a limited number of very large
providers of authoritative DNS service and a limited number of large
providers of recursive DNS service the opportunistic model described
here has the potential of enabling upgrading the transport for a
significant fraction of the DNS traffic with a limited amount of
effort.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations"><name>8. Security Considerations</name>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><strong>Spoofing of Unvalidated Hints:</strong> An OTS Hint that cannot be DNSSEC
validated (e.g., for ns.example.com where example.com is unsigned)
is susceptible to spoofing by an on-path attacker. Such an attacker
could insert a fake SVCB record advertising a non-existing transport,
thereby denying connection over that transport. However, since the
hint is opportunistic and not required for DNS resolution, the
worst-case scenario is that the resolver attempts a connection that
fails and then falls back to traditional transports.  Security for the
actual DNS data remains unaffected. The cryptographic validation of
TLS/QUIC (via X.509 certificates) for DoT/DoQ would still protect the
integrity and privacy of the connection itself.</t>
  <t><strong>DNSSEC Validation:</strong> When a OTS Hint is signed by DNSSEC (e.g.,
the ns.dnsprovider.net SVCB record from a signed dnsprovider.net zone),
it provides a trusted signal. Resolvers SHOULD leverage DNSSEC validation
to distinguish between trusted and unvalidated hints.</t>
  <t><strong>No New Attack Vectors:</strong> This mechanism does not introduce new
attack vectors for DNS data itself, as it primarily concerns transport
discovery. It relies on the existing security properties of DoT, DoH
and DoQ for actual session security.</t>
  <t><strong>Safe Rollout:</strong> As existing recursive nameservers carefully avoid
data in the Additional section that they do not need, the OTS Hint
will be ignored by everyone except recursive nameservers that
understand the OTS Hint.</t>
  <t><strong>No-OTS enables a downgrade attack:</strong> If an attacker is able to
inject a No-OTS option to an outbound query then no transport signal
will be provided. However, this is a consequence of the opportunistic
nature of the OTS Hint and not worse than not being able to do
transport signaling at all.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="operational-considerations"><name>9. Operational Considerations</name>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><strong>Response Size:</strong> Including an SVCB record in the Additional
section will increase the size of UDP responses. Authoritative server
operators should consider the potential for UDP fragmentation or TCP
fallback if responses become excessively large, though a single SVCB
record is typically small. Recursive nameservers should usually set
the EDNS(0) No-OTS when they already have the transport signaling
information.</t>
  <t><strong>Server Configuration:</strong> Authoritative server implementations will
need configuration options to enable this feature and manage the
identities list.</t>
  <t><strong>Rollout Strategy:</strong> This mechanism supports a gradual rollout.
Authoritative servers can begin sending hints without requiring
changes from resolvers, and resolvers can begin processing hints
without requiring all authoritative servers to implement the feature.</t>
  <t><strong>Monitoring:</strong> As there is extremely limited data on effects of
alternative DNS transports for communication resolver to authoritative
nameserver it is strongly suggested that monitoring (of use,
resource consumption, etc) is considered.</t>

      <t>This document describes the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) to provide privacy for DNS. Encryption provided by TLS eliminates opportunities for eavesdropping and on-path tampering with DNS queries in the network, such as discussed in RFC 7626. In addition, this document specifies two usage profiles for DNS over TLS and provides advice on performance considerations to minimize overhead from using TCP and TLS with DNS.</t>
      <t>This document focuses on securing stub-to-recursive traffic, as per the charter of the DPRIVE Working Group. It does not prevent future applications of the protocol to recursive-to-authoritative traffic.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>The SVCB DNS resource record type expresses a bound collection of endpoint metadata, for use when establishing a connection to a named service. DNS itself can be such a service, when the server is identified by a domain name. This document provides the SVCB mapping for named DNS servers, allowing them to indicate support for encrypted transport protocols.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the use of QUIC to provide transport confidentiality for DNS. The encryption provided by QUIC has similar properties to those provided by TLS, while QUIC transport eliminates the head-of-line blocking issues inherent with TCP and provides more efficient packet-loss recovery than UDP. DNS over QUIC (DoQ) has privacy properties similar to DNS over TLS (DoT) specified in RFC 7858, and latency characteristics similar to classic DNS over UDP. This specification describes the use of DoQ as a general-purpose transport for DNS and includes the use of DoQ for stub to recursive, recursive to authoritative, and zone transfer scenarios.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the "SVCB" ("Service Binding") and "HTTPS" DNS resource record (RR) types to facilitate the lookup of information needed to make connections to network services, such as for HTTP origins. SVCB records allow a service to be provided from multiple alternative endpoints, each with associated parameters (such as transport protocol configuration), and are extensible to support future uses (such as keys for encrypting the TLS ClientHello). They also enable aliasing of apex domains, which is not possible with CNAME. The HTTPS RR is a variation of SVCB for use with HTTP (see RFC 9110, "HTTP Semantics"). By providing more information to the client before it attempts to establish a connection, these records offer potential benefits to both performance and privacy.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>This document sets out steps that DNS servers (recursive resolvers and authoritative servers) can take unilaterally (without any coordination with other peers) to defend DNS query privacy against a passive network monitor. The protections provided by the guidance in this document can be defeated by an active attacker, but they should be simpler and less risky to deploy than more powerful defenses.</t>
      <t>The goal of this document is to simplify and speed up deployment of opportunistic encrypted transport in the recursive-to-authoritative hop of the DNS ecosystem. Wider easy deployment of the underlying encrypted transport on an opportunistic basis may facilitate the future specification of stronger cryptographic protections against more-powerful attacks.</t>

      <abstract>
	 <t>   A delegation in the Domain Name System (DNS) is a mechanism that
   enables efficient and distributed management of the DNS namespace.
   It involves delegating authority over subdomains to specific DNS
   servers via NS records, allowing for a hierarchical structure and
   distributing the responsibility for maintaining DNS records.

   An NS record contains the hostname of the nameserver for the
   delegated namespace.  Any facilities of that nameserver must be
   discovered through other mechanisms.  This document proposes a new
   extensible DNS record type, DELEG, for delegation the authority for a
   domain.  Future documents then can use this mechanism to use
   additional information about the delegated namespace and the
   capabilities of authoritative nameservers for the delegated
   namespace.
